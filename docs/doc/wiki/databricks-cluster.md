## üß± Databricks Cluster Types

### 1. All-Purpose Cluster

- **Designed for interactive development** (e.g., via notebooks)
- Supports **multi-user collaboration**
- Manually started, with **optional idle timeout**
- Long-running, persistent for development and testing

### 2. Job Cluster

- **Dedicated to a single scheduled job**
- **Auto-created at job start**, **auto-terminates after job completion**
- Not shareable across users or jobs
- Optimized for **production workflows and automation**

## üìä Feature Comparison

| Feature                     | All-Purpose Cluster                 | Job Cluster                          | On-Premise Hadoop/Spark Cluster       |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Lifecycle                  | Manually started, persistent        | Auto-created and terminated per job  | Long-running, manually managed         |
| Use Case                   | Development, interactive analysis   | Automated job execution              | Shared development & job execution     |
| User Access                | Multiple users can attach           | Single-job execution only            | Shared via YARN/Spark-submit           |
| Resource Management        | Managed by Databricks               | Dynamically allocated                | YARN/Mesos managed                      |
| Start/Stop Behavior        | Manual or idle timeout              | Auto-start/stop                      | Manual start, rarely stopped           |
| Cost Efficiency            | Higher (always-on)                  | High (per-job basis)                 | Fixed hardware cost, hard to scale     |
| Maintenance                | No user maintenance                 | No user maintenance                  | Requires admin support and monitoring  |

## üîÅ Conceptual Mapping

| Databricks Cluster Type | Closest On-Premise Analogy |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| All-Purpose Cluster     | Shared Spark/YARN dev cluster with shell or notebook access |
| Job Cluster             | Job scheduled via Oozie/Airflow with exclusive YARN job submission |

## üß† Summary

| Aspect              | Databricks Clusters                         | On-Prem Hadoop/Spark Cluster         |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Automation          | Highly automated (no manual setup)          | Manual deployment and monitoring     |
| Resource Isolation  | Per-job isolation (Job Cluster)             | Shared resource pool (YARN)          |
| Cost Model          | Pay-per-use (cloud billing)                 | Fixed hardware + admin costs         |
| Scalability         | Elastic (auto-scale)                        | Static, hardware-limited             |
| Ease of Use         | Seamless UI, APIs, notebooks                | Requires CLI/Spark-submit            |
